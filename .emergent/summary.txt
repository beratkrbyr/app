<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user, a cleaning company owner, initially requested a mobile application named TİTAN 360. The project scope evolved to first deploying a web-based admin panel on their Hostinger VPS, then improving its design, adding features, and finally building a public-facing website and connecting the mobile app to the new backend. The current goal is to finalize the public website's design and enable SSL.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
1.  **Admin Panel**: A functional, mobile-responsive Next.js admin panel for managing bookings, customers, and services.
2.  **Public Website**: A professional, multi-page marketing website for the TİTAN 360 brand.
3.  **Mobile App**: The existing React Native mobile app should connect to and work with the new backend.
4.  **Deployment**: The entire stack (Frontend, Backend, Database) must run on the user's Hostinger VPS (), served securely over HTTPS via the domain .

**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is **Turkish**. The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application is deployed on the user's Hostinger VPS. The FastAPI backend and MongoDB are running. A feature-rich Next.js admin panel is fully functional, with a modern dark-themed UI, sample data, and mobile-responsive design. A multi-page public-facing website has been created but has layout issues. The React Native mobile app code has been updated to point to the new backend, but login is not working.

**Last working item**:
The agent was fixing the design of the public-facing website after the user reported it looked broken.

-   **Last item agent was working**: The user complained that the website layout did not fill the page and the header was not prominent enough (sayfa bozuk duruyor tasarımı tam sayfaya uyarla ve header kısmı daha belirgin olsun). The agent started to modify  and  to fix the layout and improve the header's appearance.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent or screenshot tool to verify the UI changes on both desktop and mobile views.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Public website design is broken and needs layout corrections (P0).
-   **Issue 2**: SSL certificate installation is blocked pending DNS propagation (P1).
-   **Issue 3**: React Native mobile app login is failing (P2).

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1**: Public website design is broken.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent created a multi-page site, but the user was unhappy with the initial layout. The agent began editing  and  to address the feedback.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Complete the edits in  to ensure the main content area uses the full screen height (e.g., using  or ).
        2.  Finalize changes in  to make the header sticky, add a background blur/color, and a bottom border to make it more distinct.
        3.  Rebuild the project on the server: .
        4.  Restart the frontend process: .
        5.  Verify the new design with the screenshot tool for all pages (, , , etc.) in both desktop and mobile views.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To provide the user with a professional and visually appealing public website as requested.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None.

-   **Issue 2**: SSL certificate installation is blocked.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent confirmed the user owns , installed Certbot, and repeatedly checked DNS records using  and . The A record has not propagated yet. A script was created at  to automate certificate issuance once DNS is ready.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Periodically check for DNS propagation: .
        2.  Once the command returns the server IP (), run Certbot: .
        3.  Update the Nginx config to ensure it handles the HTTPS redirect correctly.
        4.  Update the frontend config () and mobile app config () to use the  URL.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: SSL is required for a secure, professional website and is a likely prerequisite for fixing the mobile app's mixed content login issue.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED (on DNS propagation).
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None.

-   **Issue 3**: React Native mobile app login is failing.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent added a password field to the mobile app's login screen and updated the API connection logic. A  test confirmed the backend login endpoint works, but the app login still fails, likely due to a mixed content error (app trying to access  from a secure context).
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Wait for the SSL certificate (Issue 2) to be resolved.
        2.  Update the mobile app's backend URL in  to .
        3.  Re-test the login flow in the Expo Go app.
        4.  If it still fails, check the device console logs for detailed error messages during the  request.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To ensure the user's mobile app is fully functional and connected to the admin panel.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED (on Issue 2: SSL certificate installation).
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both (mobile app frontend and server backend).

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Finalize the public-facing website design (P0).
    -   **Where to resume**: Completing the code changes in  and  for the website.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A polished, professional, multi-page website that meets the user's design expectations.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on something**: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Task**: Install SSL certificate for  once DNS propagates.
-   **Upcoming Task**: Fix the mobile application login functionality after SSL is enabled.
